The CNCF Serverless Working Group is exploring the intersection of cloud native and serverless technology.

The TOC sponsor of this WG is Ken Owens.

Join our Google Group: [cncf-wg-serverless](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cncf-wg-serverless)

Chat with us on the CNCF Slack in the #serverless channel: [https://slack.cncf.io/](https://slack.cncf.io/)

## Goals

* Provide clarity for ourselves and consumers w.r.t. what this topic is all about:
  * Define common terminology
  * Define the scope of the space as it exists today - over time this may change
  * Identify common use cases and patterns between existing implementations
  * Identify where serverless fits in relative to PaaS and container orchestration
* Identify potential next steps for the community (may or may not happen within CNCF):
  * Identifying areas where weâ€™d like to see some harmonization or interop work
* Create a whitepaper on Serverless in relation to Cloud Native.
