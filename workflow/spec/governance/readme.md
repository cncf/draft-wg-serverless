# Serverless Workflow - Project Governance

## Review Process

* A Pull Request is submitted.
* [Project owners](owners.md) review the changes and can add comments and suggestions for the changes.
* After a review, owners can approve the changes by commenting on the PR with "LGTM" ("Looks good to me"),
request changes to the PR with "CR" ("Changes requested"), or reject the PR with "NA" ("Not acceptable").
* Owners must provide an explanation for both "CR" and "NA" comments to the contributor.
* 2 "LGTM" votes (from owners other than the contributor) and no "NA" votes are needed in order for a change to be accepted.
* If there is an existing "LGTM" vote by a owner and another owner comments with "NA", then
the owners must work together to reach a consensus on the requested changes (preferably publicly including the contributor).

Note that as our contributors count increases we hope to add more owners and reviewers and update these rules accordingly.

## Conflict Resolution

If you have a technical dispute that you feel has reached an impasse with a
subset of the community, any contributor may open an issue, specifically
calling for a resolution vote of the current owners to resolve the dispute.

## Project owners

You can find the current list of project owners [here](owners.md).
