# Serverless Workflow - Project Governance

## Review Process

* A Pull Request is submitted.
* [Project owners](owners.md) review the changes and can add comments and suggestions for the changes.
* After a review, owners can approve the changes by commenting on the PR with "LGTM" ("Looks good to me"),
request changes to the PR with "CR" ("Changes requested"), or reject the PR with "NA" ("Not acceptable").
* Owners must provide an explanation for both "CR" and "NA" comments to the contributor.
* 2 "LGTM" votes (from owners other than the contributor) and no "NA" votes are needed in order for a change to be accepted.
* If there is an existing "LGTM" vote by a owner and another owner comments with "NA", then
the owners must work together to reach a consensus on the requested changes (preferably publicly including the contributor).

Note that as our contributors count increases we hope to add more owners and reviewers and update these rules accordingly.

## Conflict Resolution

If you have a technical dispute that you feel has reached an impasse with a
subset of the community, any contributor may open an issue, specifically
calling for a resolution vote of the current owners to resolve the dispute.

## Project owners

You can find the current list of project owners [here](owners.md).

### Becoming a project owner

In order to become a project owner you must:

- Adhere to the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
- Be an active community member of the project
- Demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the code and design of the project
- Help onboard new people to the project


Project owners can publicly propose community
members which have shown these characteristics to be included as owners of the project. 
Majority (>50%) vote among the existing owners must be used to accept such a proposal.
 
### Removing project owners

At times people lose interest in different projects or no longer can invest time into them. Also some owners
may no longer follow the characteristics/traits mentioned in the [above](#Becoming-a-project-owner) section. 
If this happens project owners have the ability (and responsibility) to remove themselves from the owners duties. 
This can be done via a Pull Request which removes their name from the [owners document](#owners.md).
 
It is also possible for current project owners to cast a vote to remove another owner that they feel no longer exemplifies 
owners duties/characteristics.
Majority (>50%) vote among the existing owners must be used to accept such a proposal.
