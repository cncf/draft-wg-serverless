# Serverless Workflow - Project Governance

## Review Process

* A Pull Request is submitted.
* [Project owners](owners.md) review the changes and can add comments and suggestions for the changes.
* After a review, owners can approve the changes by commenting on the PR with "LGTM" ("Looks good to me"),
request changes to the PR with "CR" ("Changes requested"), or reject the PR with "NA" ("Not acceptable").
* Owners must provide an explanation for both "CR" and "NA" comments to the contributor.
* 2 "LGTM" votes (from owners other than the contributor) and no "NA" votes are needed in order for a change to be accepted.
* If there is an existing "LGTM" vote by a owner and another owner comments with "NA", then
the owners must work together to reach a consensus on the requested changes (preferably publicly including the contributor).

Note that as our contributors count increases we hope to add more owners and reviewers and update these rules accordingly.

## Conflict Resolution

If you have a technical dispute that you feel has reached an impasse with a
subset of the community, any contributor may open an issue, specifically
calling for a resolution vote of the current owners to resolve the dispute.

## Project owners

You can find the current list of project owners [here](owners.md).

### Becoming a project owner

In order to become a project owner you must:

- Be an active community member of the project
- Actively review and be involved in pull request conversations
- Keep all communication public (via mailing lists, github comments/issues etc)
- Keep all your conversations friendly 
- Be proactive and positive
- Keep all conversations focused on actions and moving the project forward


Every three months current project owners have the chance to get together (via email list) and publicly propose community
members which have shown these characteristics to be included as owners of the project. 
Majority vote must be used to accept such a proposal.
 
### Removing project owners

At times people lose interest in different projects or no longer can invest time into them. Also some owners
may no longer follow the characteristis/traits mentioned in the [above](#Becoming-a-project-owner) section. 
If this happens project owners have the ability (and responsibility) to remove themselves from the owners duties. 
This can be done via a formal email 
 to the project mailing list where they state that they no longer wish to have owner responsibilities.
 
It is also possible for current project owners to cast a vote to remove another owner that they feel no longer exemplifies 
owners duties/characteristics. This vote can also happen once every three months.
Majority vote must be used to accept such a proposal. 

## Project maintainer

The project maintaner role is important as it includes responsibilities that go above and beyond 
those of community contributors and project owners.

In order to become a project maintainer, you must:

- Show deep knowledge of the project design and code
- Be a very active contributor
- Show to be a good community member 
- Show 100% focus on project growth (and not individual interests)

Similar to project owners, the project maintainer should publicly announce their resignation from the role 
in case they no longer have the interest or the time to invest into the project. Project owners can once every 6 month
cast a vote to replace the project maintainer. A unanymous vote should be used for such a proposal.

Currently our project does not have a project maintainer, but one should be selected as soon as possible.
