Serverless applications are becoming increasingly complex.
Often they contain complex business logic to define, coordinate, and manage the execution
order of a large amount of serverless functions and events that can trigger those functions.

Workflows have become a key component of serverless applications as they provide
clear separation between business and orchestration logic.

Serverless Workflow is a specification that defines the model for workflows
responsible for orchestrating event-driven serverless applications.

Main goals of the specification include:

- To facilitate Serverless Workflow portability across different vendor platforms
- To be completely vendor neutral
- To support both stateless and stateful Serverless Workflow orchestration
- To define a light-weight and powerful Serverless Workflow model

Serverless Workflow is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation's](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF) [Serverless Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless). It was proposed as a Cloud Native sandbox level project on [March 3, 2020](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/376).
